# SaraKIT_Basics

This demo shows how to use one of the encoders included in the SaraKIT (AS5048A) based on the Raspberry PI CM4 to control the speed of another gimbal.
By turning the gimbal in one direction (0..180 degrees) we control the speed forward, in the other (-180..0 degrees) we control the speed backwards. The more we deflect the position, the greater the speed we achieve.
Of course, you can use the AS5048A decoder itself by connecting it via PWN to one of the two connectors on the SaraKIT board.
